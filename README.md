## NOTE

This library needs to be vendored (pre-compiled and committed to the repo) because it needs to exist before the build
step of all the other projects.

# @curri/nx-aws-cache-runner

A tool for using AWS S3 as a distributed computational cache for Nx.

## AWS settings

There are two ways to set-up AWS options:

### Using nx.json

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nx-aws-plugin/nx-aws-cache",
      "options": {
        ...
        "awsRegion": "eu-central-1",
        "awsBucket": "bucket-name",
        "awsProfile": "profile-1",
        "awsEndpoint": "http://custom.de-eu.myhost.com"
      }
    }
  }
```

### Using environment variables

```bash
NX_AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
NX_AWS_BUCKET=bucket-name
NX_AWS_PROFILE=profile-1
NX_AWS_ENDPOINT=[URL] # default s3.[region].amazonaws.com
```

> Environment variables can be set using `.env` file -
> check [dotenv documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Disabling S3 cache

Remote cache can be disabled in favor of local cache only using an environment variable

```bash
NX_AWS_DISABLE=true
```

## Authentication

### Default

AWS authentication can be set-up using default environment variables or using shared credentials, based
on [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).

### SSO login

To authenticate with SSO via CLI run

`aws sso login`

AWS SDK v3 is used under the hood with a support
for [SSO login](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html).

### Custom environment variables

Custom environment variables can be set for an alternate way of authentication

```bash
NX_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[secret]
NX_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[secret]
```

## Build

Run `yarn nx build nx-aws-cache` to build the plugin. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use
the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn nx test nx-aws-cache` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `yarn nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn nx e2e nx-aws-cache` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `yarn nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Credits

This repository is based on a similar NX plugin using Azure
Storage [@nx-azure/storage-cache](https://github.com/microsoft/nx-azure) which was inspired by Nx Cloud Plugin
by [Nrwl](https://github.com/nrwl/nx).
